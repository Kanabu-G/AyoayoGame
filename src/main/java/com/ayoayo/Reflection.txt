Ayoayo Game Project Reflection
Initial Reflection
When I first approached this project, my initial understanding was to build a simple text-based version of the Ayoayo board game following the provided rules. My plan was to implement a straightforward array-based solution with the Player class and Ayoayo game logic class. I chose Java for its object-oriented programming features which aligned well with the project requirements.

My initial approach was to:

Create a basic array representation of the board
Implement the core game mechanics one by one
Add the special rules (extra turns and captures)
Create a simple text-based interface for gameplay

I thought the implementation would be relatively straightforward: represent the board as a linear array, implement seed distribution, and add special rules as conditions. I planned to develop features incrementally, testing each component before moving to the next.

Final Reflection
Significant Changes to my Plan
The most significant change to my initial plan came when I realized my initial board representation didn't properly model the counter-clockwise movement specified in the rules. I had to completely refactor the board representation and seed distribution logic.

Original board representation:
[Player 1's pits (0-5)][Player 1's store (6)][Player 2's pits (7-12)][Player 2's store (13)]

Refactored representation to correctly model counter-clockwise movement:
Player 2:   [6][5][4][3][2][1]  (indices 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7 in array)
Stores:     [P2]              [P1]  (indices 13, 6 in array)
Player 1:   [1][2][3][4][5][6]  (indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in array)

Challenges Encountered

1. Board Representation Challenge: The most significant challenge was correctly modeling the counter-clockwise movement. My initial implementation didn't properly respect the game's circular nature. I overcame this by reconceptualizing the board layout and adjusting the indices accordingly.

2. Special Rules Implementation: Implementing the capture rule was complex because it required determining the opposite pit. The formula for calculating this wasn't immediately obvious and required careful consideration of the board's layout.

3. Turn Management: Properly handling the "take another turn" special rule in the interactive game proved challenging. I initially missed this in my implementation but later added tracking within the Ayoayo class to properly manage whose turn it was.

4. Pit Indexing: I had to be careful about how I mapped the user's input (1-6) to array indices, especially for Player 2 where the pits are displayed in reverse order to maintain the counter-clockwise flow.

Key Takeaways

1. Importance of Visualization: Properly visualizing the game board was crucial for implementing the correct game logic. Text-based games still need a clear mental model of the game state.

2. Incremental Testing: Testing each component incrementally was vital. When I refactored the board representation, I could quickly verify that my changes preserved the game rules.

3. Rule Precision: The specific rules of Ayoayo - especially the counter-clockwise movement and special conditions required careful attention to detail. Small misinterpretations could lead to significant logic errors.

4. Code Flexibility: Designing the code to be flexible from the beginning would have made the refactoring process smoother. My initial assumptions about the board layout proved incorrect, and I had to make substantial changes.

5. User Experience Considerations: Even in a text-based game, user experience matters. I improved the interactive version to provide clearer feedback about whose turn it was.

Conclusion
This project demonstrated the importance of fully understanding the problem domain before implementation. While my initial approach seemed reasonable, I didn't fully grasp the minute aspects of the game board. The refactoring process taught me valuable lessons about designing for circularity in board games and handling complex rule interactions.
The final implementation successfully captures the essence of Ayoayo, with proper counter-clockwise movement, correct implementation of special rules, and a clean text-based interface. The project showcases how object-oriented design principles can be applied to model traditional board games effectively.
